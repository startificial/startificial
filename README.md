- 👋 Hi, I’m @startificial
- 👀 I’m interested in the invisible world of data and how it shapes our lives. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to stand up big data infrastructure on public cloud as well as spending some time building a side project using Next.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with data science, data engineering, or machine learning focused.
